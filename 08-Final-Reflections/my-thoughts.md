# Final Reflections

## What I thought Git was before this project

Before this lab, I honestly didn’t know much about Git other than the basic commands like `git clone` to download repos.  
I had used GitHub many times in the past to download apps or install packages, but I never really thought about how those projects were managed behind the scenes.  
I thought Git was just for uploading and downloading files.  
I had no real idea what version control meant or why teams would need it.  
Also, I used to avoid Git in my own personal projects because I found it confusing and a bit intimidating.

## What I now understand deeply

After going through every lab in this project, I now understand how powerful Git really is.  
I know how to set up a repo, track changes, commit updates, and push them to remote repositories like GitHub.  
I feel confident with using branches for feature development and then merging them back into the main project.  
I also learned how `HEAD` works, how commits are stored, and how the staging area works.  
One of the biggest lessons for me was using `reflog` to recover work I thought was lost forever.  
I now fully understand the difference between `merge` and `rebase`, and when it makes sense to use each.  
I also know how to use `cherry-pick` to apply individual commits between branches, and how to use `commit --amend` to fix mistakes in the last commit.  
This knowledge will definitely help me in any future team projects.

## What was hardest and what finally clicked

At first, branching and merging was confusing for me.  
I didn’t understand why people would create so many branches or what merging actually did.  
The biggest challenge was understanding `merge` vs `rebase`.  
I had to visualize the commit history a few times with `git log --graph` before it finally clicked for me.  
Creating and resolving merge conflicts also helped me understand how Git manages changes between branches.  
Once I actually did it myself in Folder 07, I felt way more comfortable.  
Another thing that confused me in the beginning was the difference between `soft reset`, `mixed reset`, and `hard reset`.  
The `git reset` and `reflog` labs taught me that even when things go wrong, there’s almost always a way to recover.

## My overall takeaway

This project made Git go from a scary, confusing tool to something I actually enjoy using.  
Now I understand exactly how Git works under the hood, and I don’t just rely on tutorials or random Stack Overflow answers anymore.  
I feel confident that I can use Git for personal projects and also contribute to real team projects in the future.  
I am proud of how far I came by doing all the experiments, breaking things, fixing them, and documenting everything along the way.  
This Git-Mastery-Lab is one of my favorite learning projects so far.
