# Git-User-Manual


## Purpose of this Repository

- This repository documents how I learned Version Control system and Git. You can also follow along by following steps and trying examples from the screenshots.
- For me, this is kind of a personal library. I can come here anytime if I forget a command or a concept related to Git.
- This is a practical-based documentation, so I already expect you to know the basic linux commands because I won't be covering fundamentals.

## How to Navigate This Repository

- Firslty, read the Basic-Concepts.md file because it explains all the theory you will need for it.
- Do the labs yourself, don't just read.
- Copy the commands and try them in your machine, just reading will paralyze you.
- Follow the order of folders, if you jump to a random topic then I don't you will be able to get it.

## Overall Personal Experience

Before this project, I saw Git as a confusing tool mainly used to upload or download files from GitHub, with no real understanding of version control or its role in team workflows. Now, I understand Git’s internal workings—how to set up and manage repositories, track and commit changes, work with branches, merge or rebase strategically, and recover from mistakes using tools like reflog and reset.
This project turned Git from something I avoided into a powerful tool I feel confident using in both personal and team environments—making this a valuable learning experience.
