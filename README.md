# Git-Mastery-Lab

My personal Git practice lab to demonstrate a full understanding of Git version control and workflows.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository documents my structured journey to master Git.  
It covers not only command-line usage but also real-world workflows such as branching, conflict resolution, rebasing, cherry-picking, undoing mistakes, and working with remotes.

## How to Navigate This Lab

Each folder includes:

- Hands-on exercises
- Documentation of actions and outcomes
- Reflections on what I expected vs. what actually happened
- Explanations of core concepts in my own words

You can explore the folders sequentially or focus on specific areas of interest.
