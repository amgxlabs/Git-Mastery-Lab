# Git-User-Manual


## Purpose of this Repository

- This repository documents how I learned Version Control system and Git. You can also follow along by following steps and trying examples from the screenshots.
- For me, this is kind of a personal library. I can come here anytime if I forget a command or a concept related to Git.
- This is a practical-based documentation, so I already expect you to know the basic linux commands because I won't be covering fundamentals.

## How to Navigate This Repository

- Firslty, read the Basic-Concepts.md file because it explains all the theory you will need for it.
- Do the labs yourself, don't just read.
- Copy the commands and try them in your machine, just reading will paralyze you.
- Follow the order of folders, if you jump to a random topic then I don't you will be able to get it.
